                <p>The department of Instrumentation and Control Engineering was started in the year 1992-93 with the intake of 45 and later it was increased to 60. As indicated by the continuous opinion from the alumnae and up to date necessities from the core industries, the department has been renamed as Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering and started as a new course in the academic year 2007-08 onwards with a sanctioned intake of 60. Presently it is increased to 120.
                   The main aim of this department is, to fulfill the requirement in frontier technology of Electronics and Instrumentation in the area of manufacturing, power plant, petrochemical, gas industries and industrial automation, etcâ€¦
                   The department has been continuously imparting standard and quality service to the students for the past 21 years. 14 batches of undergraduates in ICE discipline and 7 batches in EIE discipline have graduated from this department. The department has been inculcating moral values in addition to the curricular and co-curricular activities.  </p>
