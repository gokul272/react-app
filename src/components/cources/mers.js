                    <p>The Department of Civil Engineering was started in 1993. It is accredited by National Board of Accreditation of AICTE, New Delhi. The department offers Post Graduate Programme (M.Tech.) in Remote Sensing from the academic year 2009-2010. Demonstrated capabilities of the department is endorsed by the ongoing sponsored and curiosity driven research projects. The advanced software and equipment are being used for training, research and consultancy works.</p>
                    <p>The Department has well equipped laboratories with state-of-the-art tools. Dynamic, experienced and committed faculty with more accountability is the strength of the department.</p>

                    <p>Remote sensing helps the earth observers and land managers in providing updated and detailed information about spatial features and processes. Remote sensing has enabled mapping, studying, monitoring and management of various resources like agriculture, forest, land, soil, mineral, water, ocean, etc. The programme is designed towards sensibly addressing habitat sustenance practices and making optimal use of natural resources. The students of the programme will be imparted skills to handle variety of satellite products like Cartosat 1 & 2, LISS III, LISS IV, QuickBird, OCM, AVHRR, MODIS, SAR, etc.</p>
